      "I recently heard this riddle from a friend at a campfire. I wasn't smart enough to come up with the answer, \n",

      "There are 50 prisoners, and one prison keeper. The prisoners will be placed in separate cells, never \n",
      "able to communicate. Once per day, the prison keeper will randomly select one prisoner and take him \n",
      "into a room with two levers. The levers have two positions each: Up, and down. The prisoner may operate \n",
      "the levers however he wishes, then he must return to his cell. (The levers don't do anything; they \n",
      "just represent a binary state.) The prisoners have one chance to indicate to the prison keeper whether \n",

      "Only one lever is needed. Elect one prisoner to be a 'counter.' When a prisoner enters the lever room and \n",
      "the lever is in the 'down' position and he has never moved the lever, then and only then will he move the \n",
      "lever to the 'up' position. Only the 'counter' prisoner may return the lever to the 'down' position, and \n",
      "each time he does so he increments a counter. When the counter reaches 50, he knows that all prisoners have \n",
